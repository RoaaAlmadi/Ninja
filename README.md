it is a game created using spriteKit
 -the character is a ball that spins in its place and uses gravity to jump
 
 -the background and ground runs in a loop infinitely.
they cary on top of them the obstacles blocks and coins which are generated randomly. 

-the obstacles take a life the blokes take a coin and the coin add a coin to your high score

-you can either mute the music or the sound effect or both at the same time

-you can pause the game and re run it or exit it at any moment if you click on the pause btn 

-if you loose 3 lives or cross the left wall GAME OVER 


# ***Side note

    it was really hard creating it since we didn't play much with spriteKit but i really wanted to create a little game before i return my macMini lol. I had to watch lots of tutorials and get lots of inspirations. but the hardest thing was that all the tutorials are many years old, so I faced lots of errors. but it was really fun and rewarding when it worked fine at the end. I had a lot of fun
